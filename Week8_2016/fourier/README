The fourier transform for the pure sine wave would look like a step.

The discrete fourier transform for the pure sine wave would just have two peaks.

                         |
                         |

As the function gets more and more complicated, there will be more "steps" in the fourier transform and more peaks in the discrete fourier transform.
