The problem arises due to the limited available precision of floating point numbers. This causes rounding errors which are amplified when you are adding numbers of vastly different amplitudes such as 1 and 1e-8 due to the fact that 1 + 1e-8 is similar enough to 1 that the digit very far to the right of the decimal point is ignored. Normally, this wouldn't be really much of an issue but when you are continuously adding 1e-8 to the sum many number of times, your error gets bigger and bigger, which is the case here.
