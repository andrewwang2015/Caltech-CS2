1. This solution will always deadlock because it has every philosopher pick up the fork to the left and then pick up the fork to the right. However, if each philosopher picks up the fork to the left of them and is waiting on the fork to their right to free up, then all the forks will have been picked up and each philosopher will be unable to pick up a fork to his/her right. Thus, we reach a deadlock state. There is a nonzero probability that this setup will deadlock, so given infinite time, one will reach the deadlock state.

2. The maximum number of people that can sit down at the table at one time is 4. As long as one philosopher can eat, it prevents deadlock because once this philosopher is done eating, he/she can put down the forks he just used so that neighboring philosophers can use them. The problem with 5 people, as described above is that once they all pick up one fork, they cannot get the other fork because it is already possessed. With one less person, this frees up the fork that he/she would have possessed so that one of the neighbors of the missing philosopher can thus eat, thereby avoiding deadlock. With 4 people, there are still 5 forks so if one person will have the opportunity to pick up two forks and eat.

3. If philosophers all begin with dirty, left forks and each requests a fork from his neighbor, the first philosopher will clean his dirty fork and give it to his neighbor who will clean his own dirty fork and give it to his neighbor who will then also clean his dirty fork and give it to his neighbor and so on until all philosophers have clean forks. Because they all each have a clean fork now, they cannot pass it along via request and also cannot eat because they do not possess two forks. We have arrived at deadlock in this case.
